# Conclusion of Julian Walker

# Red black trees are interesting beasts. They're believed to be simpler than
# AVL trees (their direct competitor), and at first glance this seems to be the
# case because insertion is a breeze. However, when one begins to play with the
# deletion algorithm, red black trees become very tricky. However, the
# counterweight to this added complexity is that both insertion and deletion
# can be implemented using a single pass, top-down algorithm. Such is not the
# case with AVL trees, where only the insertion algorithm can be written top-down.
# Deletion from an AVL tree requires a bottom-up algorithm.

# So when do you use a red black tree? That's really your decision, but I've
# found that red black trees are best suited to largely random data that has
# occasional degenerate runs, and searches have no locality of reference. This
# takes full advantage of the minimal work that red black trees perform to
# maintain balance compared to AVL trees and still allows for speedy searches.

# Red black trees are popular, as most data structures with a whimsical name.
# For example, in Java and C++, the library map structures are typically
# implemented with a red black tree. Red black trees are also comparable in
# speed to AVL trees. While the balance is not quite as good, the work it takes
# to maintain balance is usually better in a red black tree. There are a few
# misconceptions floating around, but for the most part the hype about red black
# trees is accurate.
